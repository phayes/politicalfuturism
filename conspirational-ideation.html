			<h3>Crazy Beliefs, Sane Believers: Toward a Cognitive Psychology of Conspiracy Ideation</h3>

			<h4 class="author"><a href="http://www.csicop.org/author/preston_bost">Preston R. Bost</a></h4>
			<h4 class="issue"><a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/archive/category/volume_39.1"><span class="mag">Skeptical Inquirer</span> Volume 39.1, January/February 2015</a></h4>

			<blockquote>Where do conspiracy beliefs come from? Recent behavioral research suggests that they do not reflect pathology or lazy
				thinking but may instead come from normal, rational minds. </blockquote>

		</div>

		<div class="clear"></div>

		<p>As part of its educational mission, the Skeptical Inquirer regularly publishes critical investigations into conspiracy
			theories—claims that organizations of powerful, self-serving entities manipulate world events for their own benefit behind
			the scenes, away from the prying eyes of the public. Readers of this magazine are familiar with the common properties
			of conspiracy theories: their selective sifting of evidence (McHoskey 1995), their habit of growing more complicated and
			improbable over time to incorporate additional actors and events (Keeley 1999), their astonishing tendency to assimilate
			disconfirming evidence as further evidence <em>in favor</em> of the theory (Kramer and Gavrieli 2005), and their poisonous
			influence on discourse about public institutions and policies (Swami 2012). It is of little wonder that the skeptical
			community’s attempts at education are leavened with hostility. Much of our language, often in so many words, conveys the
			belief that conspiracy theories are the product of anti-intellectual and even psychologically disordered minds.</p>
		<p>
			This palpable frustration is an understandable reaction to failing in the skeptical mission. And fail we have, at least in
			educating the populace not to believe in conspiracy theories. In the nearly four decades of this publication, belief in
			conspiracy theories (which I will term “conspiracy ideation”) shows no signs of abating, let alone disappearing. Conspiracy
			theories remain a staple of American popular culture (Kelley-Romano 2008) and are readily found in cultures across the
			globe (Sunstein and Vermeule 2009; Swami and Coles 2010). To compound skeptics’ frustration, they tend to coexist with
			paranormal beliefs (Drinkwater et al. 2012; Swami et al. 2011), especially New Age beliefs (Newheiser et al. 2011). And
			one well-known research finding is that conspiracy theories, like other deeply held beliefs, are strongly resistant to
			disconfirmation (McHoskey 1995; Nyhan and Reifler 2010; Sunstein and Vermeule 2009).</p>
		<p>
			One irony of this state of affairs is that the skeptical community has engaged the discussion of conspiracies while missing
			a significant arrow in its quiver: a scientific understanding of the psychological underpinnings of conspiracy ideation.
			Until recently, there has been little behavioral research into the structure of conspiracy ideation, the people who adopt
			conspiratorial beliefs, and the circumstances under which they adopt them. This omission is puzzling because conspiracy
			theories exist not on the fringe but in the mainstream, enough so to be regarded as cognitively normal. As such they invite
			careful study of why they easily take root in the human mind (Bost and Prunier 2013; Drinkwater et al. 2012; Swami and
			Coles 2010). Fortunately, the number of peer-reviewed empirical publications on the topic has increased rapidly in only
			the last five years. As the literature has matured, our theoretical understanding of the origins of conspiracy ideation
			has begun to sharpen. </p>
		<p>Perhaps the most consistent finding is that people are relatively consistent in their conspiracy ideation; if they believe
			one conspiracy theory, they tend to have other conspiratorial beliefs (e.g. Swami et al. 2011). This pattern holds if
			the second belief is a real-life conspiracy theory (Swami and Furnham 2012), a general belief that conspiracies regulate
			human events (Steiger et al. 2013), a fictitious conspiracy story (Swami et al. 2011), or a view of oneself as a victim
			of conspiracies in one’s own life (Butler et al. 1995). Interestingly, conspiracy ideation also can bridge contradictory
			theories; Wood and colleagues (Wood et al. 2012) observed that participants who endorsed the belief that Princess Diana
			had been murdered also tended to endorse the claim that she had faked her death. Researchers have taken these findings
			to confirm one of the first clearly articulated theories of conspiracy ideation: Goertzel’s (1994) concept of a monological
			belief system, in which conspiracy ideation is a world­view—rather than a collection of discrete beliefs—in which multiple
			conspiracy theories reinforce each other. Although researchers have found that certain conspiracy theories are bound to
			a particular social/political context and not predictive of general conspiracy ideation (Swami 2012), the literature is
			converging on the conclusion that in the main, conspiracy ideation reflects a generalized way of thinking about the world
			(Brotherton et al. 2013; Wood et al. 2012). </p>
		<p>
			The next question, therefore, is how this mode of thought arises. The research agenda so far has strongly emphasized the
			pursuit of the “conspiracy theorist”—the person with a constellation of traits that predisposes him or her to conspiracy
			ideation. To what extent can we draw a sharp distinction between the psychological profiles of the conspiracy believer
			and the conspiracy skeptic? The research on this question has been, to put it mildly, mixed. First, a surprise: conspiracy
			ideation does not appear to reflect an inability or disinclination to think critically. For instance, conspiracy ideation
			has not been linked to lower levels of education (Bogart and Thorburn 2006; Clark et al. 2008; Parsons et al. 1999; Simmons
			and Parsons 2005). In fact, in certain cases education may enhance conspiracy ideation; those educated about documented
			race-based conspiracies, such as the infamous Tuskeegee syphilis study, are more likely to endorse race-based conspiracy
			theories in which the United States government is alleged to be targeting the African-American population (Nelson et al.
			2010). Further, conspiracy ideation is not correlated with “need for cognition”—a reliable measure of the inclination
			to engage in complex critical thinking (Abakalina-Papp et al. 1999). Neither is it associated with “need for cognitive
			closure,” a trait characterized by oversimplification of complex issues and biased assimilation of evidence (Leman and
			Cinnirella 2013).</p>
		<p>
			What about personality? An examination of the Big Five dimensions (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,
			agreeableness, and neuroticism), which together capture the primary vectors of human personality, has been only marginally
			revealing. Swami and colleagues (Swami et al. 2010; Swami et al. 2011; Swami and Furnham 2012) have observed that conspiracy
			ideation is associated with lower levels of agreeableness (a trait that captures one’s ability to get along with others
			and accept them as good-faith actors), but this association has not always been replicated (Furnham 2013). Negative associations
			between conspiracy ideation and other dimensions, such as neuroticism and openness to experience, have been reported (Furnham
			2013; Swami et al. 2013), but overall the correlations between conspiracy ideation and Big Five traits tend to be small
			and/or unstable (Brotherton et al. 2013). </p>

		</div>



		<p>
			Demographic variables present a mixed bag. Conspiratorial worldviews are not generally related to either age or sex (e.g.,
			Parsons et al. 1999; Simmons and Parsons 2005). Racial and political affiliation also are not associated with general
			conspiratorial ideation, but do appear to predict belief in particular conspiracies to which one’s group may be vulnerable
			(e.g. Abakalina-Paap et al. 1999)—an important pattern to which we will return later. For example, African Americans,
			much more so than whites, endorse conspiracy theories in which African Americans are the targets—such as the claim that
			the United States government created the HIV virus to exterminate the black population (e.g. Bogart and Thorburn 2003).</p>
		<p>Although numerous researchers have argued that psychopathology is insufficient to account for the prevalence of conspiracy
			theories (Kramer and Gavrieli 2005; Steiger et al. 2013; Swami and Coles 2010; Uscinski et al. 2011), others have forcefully
			argued for a conceptual relation between conspiratorial ideation and the distortions of reality characteristic of paranoia
			(Zonis and Joseph 1994). Researchers have consistently found that conspiracy ideation is associated with low levels of
			trust (Abakalina-Papp et al. 1999; Goertzel 1994) and even subclinical paranoia (Darwin et al. 2011; Grzesiak-Feldman
			and Ejsmont 2008). Research also has probed whether conspiracy ideation is related to schizotypy, a personality disorder
			characterized in part by lower-grade, dispositional suspicion of the type found in some forms of schizophrenia. Using
			a scale called the O-LIFE (Mason et al. 1995), which measures four discrete dimensions of schizotypy, Swami and colleagues
			(Swami et al. 2013) observed that conspiracy ideation is associated with higher scores on the Unusual Experiences Scale,
			which measures suspicion as well as other perceptual and cognitive distortions. It appears therefore that conspiracy ideation
			is reliably related to suspicion. Because suspicion requires selective attention to another’s motive, these findings connect
			with the observation that acceptance of fictional conspiracy stories increases when the story highlights the potential
			motive of the alleged conspirator, even when the documented evidence of a conspiracy is poor (Bost and Prunier 2013).
			Importantly, the connection between suspicion and conspiracy ideation does not in itself imply that the suspicion is pathological.
			Numerous authors have argued that a degree of suspicion is an adaptive trait in humans, who rely on it to promote equity
			in the transactions inherent to social living (for one such argument, see Vohs et al. 2007). Attention to others’ motives,
			although characteristic of paranoia (Darwin et al. 2011), is therefore an ingredient in everyday social interaction (e.g.,
			Cosmides and Tooby 1992). Seen in this light, conspiracy ideation represents not an irrational departure from reality
			but perhaps rather an intensified focus on information that all humans regularly rely on in social cognition. In other
			words, some conspiracy ideation may be grounded in the rules of human cognition, which employ a dose of suspicion as a
			protective mechanism. This notion is broadly consistent with Sunstein and Vermeule’s (2009, 208) suggestion that conspiracy
			theories require that all events be seen as the product of some actor’s intention.</p>
		<p>
			The extent to which the suspicion of a conspiracy believer is primary (that is, ingrained as its own personality trait) or
			instead derives from other cognitions or circumstances is unclear. One of the earliest and most interesting findings in
			the literature is that those who believe in conspiracies demonstrate higher levels of powerlessness and alienation from
			institutions (Goertzel 1994; Abakalina-Paap et al. 1999; Swami et al. 2010). These findings suggest that conspiracy theorists
			perceive themselves as vulnerable to exploitation—a circumstance that would call for heightened suspicion. Kramer and
			Gavrieli (2005) have argued that threat perception—really, hypervigilance to threat—is central to conspiracy ideation.
			If true, this notion may explain a pattern discussed earlier: that even those who are not predisposed to conspiracy ideation
			may nonetheless accept a conspiracy theory if the alleged target is their racial, social, or political affiliation. Again,
			this framework ascribes a type of rationality to the conspiratorial mindset, grounding it in the defensive posture of
			someone with a heightened sensitivity to potential threat.</p>

			/>
		</div>


		<p>
			Recent findings confirm the basic idea that threat perception and/or perceived vulnerability contribute to conspiracy ideation.
			In one particularly important study, Whitson and Galinsky (2008) conducted a series of experiments manipulating the extent
			to which participants perceived control over their worlds—for instance, by having them recall different types of autobiographical
			memories in which they were more or less in control of events, or by describing the stock market as either random (i.e.,
			unpredictable or out of control) or stable, or by having them engage in a novel cognitive task in which the feedback to
			participants was either meaningful (suggesting that the participant had control over the outcome) or random. Across the
			experiments, participants whose sense of control had been undermined consistently tended to over-perceive patterns in
			subsequent stimuli by making illusory correlations, seeing visual images in random dots, and—notably—perceiving a greater
			likelihood of conspiracy behind a fictitious event. The authors argued that these false alarms reflect not oversimplification
			of the available data but a sophisticated exercise in pattern perception. These findings lend some empirical support to
			a proposal articulated by Michael Shermer: that conspiracy theories are a byproduct of an innate human tendency to seek
			patterns in the environment, preferring false alarms to misses (Shermer 2011; for elaboration on this point, see Kramer
			and Gavrieli 2005). Whitson and Galinsky (2008) refine this perspective by defining some of the conditions in which enhanced
			pattern-seeking may be invoked—specifically the experience of a threat to one’s sense of control over events in one’s
			life.
		</p>
		<p>
			What types of perceived threats appear related to conspiracy beliefs, and where do these perceptions come from? Grzesiak-Feldman
			(2007; 2013) has studied the relationships among dispositional anxiety (“trait”), anxiety in the moment (“state” anxiety),
			and beliefs in specific conspiracies, yielding inconsistent findings. It appears that the arousal of simple anxiousness
			is insufficient to evoke conspiratorial ideation, and that the perceived threat must instead have a particular flavor.
			In some cases the threat is more general and dispositional. Newheiser et al. (2011) observed that existential threat—anxiety
			related to one’s mortality—was a predictor of belief in the Da Vinci Code conspiracy. For others, the threat appears to
			be more specific and experiential: Bogart and Thorburn (2006) noted that African-American men, who report more experiences
			with discrimination than African-American women, also report greater belief in conspiracy theories related to the medical
			establishment, which plays a prominent role in claims that the HIV virus was created to eradicate the African-American
			population. For still others, the threat may be political: Uscinski and colleagues’ (2011) inventory of letters to the
			<em>New York Times</em> found that conspiracy allegations tracked with the movement of political parties in and out of
			power, with minority-party affiliates primarily responsible for propagating government-related conspiracy theories. Sometimes
			the threat emerges from a specific event. Rothschild et al. (2012) found that when participants read about environmental
			destruction caused by unknown forces, they attributed the blame to a scapegoat—an entity with the means and desire to
			subvert others’ well-being for its own gain. Blaming the scapegoat restored participants’ feelings of control. Importantly,
			participants given a chance to affirm their feelings of personal control were less likely to blame the scapegoat.</p>
		<p>Taken together with Whitson and Galinsky’s (2008) findings, this pattern of results suggests that a lack of control over
			one’s fate—a sense of being vulnerable to outside forces—tends to heighten vigilance, increasing the tendency to look
			for patterns and for someone to blame; such is the raw material of conspiracy theories. Increasingly, therefore, those
			who study conspiracy ideation have been forgoing references to pathology, substituting instead the language of cognitive
			adaptation. There is a long tradition in the cognitive sciences of seeing “errors” in reasoning as reflections of the
			normal operation of our goal-oriented information processing systems, and perhaps we can think of conspiracy theories
			this way as well. As Kramer and Gavrieli (2005, 248) put it, “. . . Conspiracy theories can be construed as complex forms
			of social cognition that are the end product of an intendedly adaptive sensemaking or coping process.” Given that humans
			possess the cognitive apparatus required to avoid exploitation (Cosmides and Tooby 1992), it seems reasonable—though not
			theoretically definitive at present—to consider that conspiracy ideation could be a natural byproduct of such a system,
			triggered by cues such as perceived vulnerability, or the perception that the alleged conspirator has a motive to engage
			in subterfuge (Bost et al. 2010; Bost and Prunier 2013; Sunstein and Vermeule 2009).</p>
		<p>
			This article began with the suggestion that we have had little success in beating back conspiracy theories in part because
			we have failed to study sufficiently the psychological processes underpinning such beliefs. Though a full discussion of
			the topic is beyond the scope of this article, researchers continue to argue that conspiratorial ideation has harmful
			effects on both public discourse and personal behavior (e.g., Jolly 2013) and is therefore worth fighting. What hope does
			the recent surge in research offer? One suggestion implicit in the literature is that we may have to live with some level
			of conspiracy ideation as a byproduct of the cognitive architecture that comes with communal living. A person without
			the capacity for suspicion is a target for exploitation, and the necessary kernel of suspicion that exists in all of us
			might well become turbocharged under the proper circumstances.</p>
		<p>
			And here is where the research has begun to make significant strides: in shifting the conversation ever so slightly from
			the image of foil-hat-wearing, conspiracy-believing “other people” to a more forgiving conception of conspiracy ideation
			arising in normal people exposed to the proper triggers—for example, circumstances that evoke feelings of vulnerability.
			With research having failed so far to draw a bright line between the forensic profiles of conspiracy believers and nonbelievers,
			searching for additional triggers may be a fruitful avenue for further investigation. Those of us in this young field
			should also push forward in refining the operational definition of “conspiracy ideation.” Researchers have crafted many
			different surveys to measure conspiracy beliefs, most of them with uncertain psychometric properties (Brotherton et al.
			2013). Agreement on properly validated measurements will ultimately help the research community determine which of the
			current findings merit our confidence over the long term. In the meantime, the skeptical community may find reason to
			be less frustrated with conspiracy believers. The research findings so far have done much to humanize them.</p>
