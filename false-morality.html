			<h3>The false morality of hate</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Patrick Hayes</h4>

		</div>

		<div class="clear"></div>

		<p>The recent spat of violence has me thinking about hate, and the stories hateful people tell themselves to justify their actions in their own minds. If we can understand the false moral reasoning
			behind hateful acts, we might be able to build a culture whose moral reasoning does not lead to heinous acts of violence
			and hate. </p>

		<p><a href="http://moralfoundations.org">Moral foundations theory</a> [1] is a theory of how humans rationalize their moral decisions. Moral foundations theory states that
			humans ground their moral reasoning in six "moral foundations" and that all moral reasoning takes place using one or more of these core foundational stories.</p>

		<p>The six moral foundations are listed in the image below. Each of these is a moral archetype, and all the stories we tell
			ourselves to morally justify our actions will fit into one of these foundational moral stories. </p>

		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/13495482_10157110226195074_617982424680819043_o.jpg?oh=08eeaf6b30e7517f0336bf4374d43763&oe=594A878B"></img>
		</div>

		<p>Much of the research in Moral Foundations involves applying the theory to political "cultures" such as those of liberals
			and conservatives, who tend to prefer different foundations. Moral Foundations theory doesn't pass judgement on the validity
			of any of these moral foundations, but rather studies which groups of people tend to use which foundations. </p>

		<p>However, only some of these moral foundations lay the groundwork for the moral justification of hate and violence. </p>

		<p>In June of 2016, British Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered. She was an outspoken supporter of the Labour Friends of Palestine & the
			Middle East and called for the lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip. She also opposed efforts by the government to
			curtail the BDS movement, stating "I believe that this is a gross attack on democratic freedoms. It [is our] right to
			boycott unethical companies." Her politics pointed towards a moral foundation that leaned heavily on the last three pillars,
			especially foundation six (freedom). </p>

		<p>She was murdered by Thomas Mair, who allegedly yelled "put Britain first!" as he murdered her. He would later proclaim
			"Death to traitors" at his court appearance. Thomas Mair had a story running in his head telling him that murdering Jo
			Cox was a morally justified killing in the name of defending Britain against enemies without and within. His paranoid
			worldview was fuelled by the moral foundation of putting country first, at all costs, clearly leaning entirely on the
			first moral foundation of in-group loyalty. </p>

		<p>On June 12th, 2016, American Omar Mateen opened fire inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. He killed 49 LGBTQ+ people, and wounded
			an additional 53. Omar Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, spoke to NBC News about the shooting . “This had nothing to do with
			religion. We were in downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music. And he saw two men kissing each other in front
			of his wife and kid and he got very angry,” Seddique told NBC. “They were kissing each other and touching each other and
			he said, 'Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.'” He would make a series of internet posts over the next
			day detailing his disgust with the "filthy ways of the West" before going to the Pulse nightclub and perpetrating the
			worst mass shooting in American history, squarely targeting LGBTQ+ people.
			<p/>

			<p>Mateen was operating under the assumption that his personal disgust was a valid foundation for moral reasoning (foundation
				three - sanctity). This obsession with purity is also what drives honor-killings in some parts of the world. Amnesty
				International, in describing honor-killings, states, "Family members have no socially acceptable alternative but to remove
				the stain on their honour by attacking the woman." It is no surprise that honor-killings disproportionally target LGBTQ+
				people and women. </p>

			<p>Readers will also be aware that the moral reasoning that drove the Nazis to ethnically cleanse their territories of "Untermenschen"
				was also based on ideas of purity (foundation three), loyalty to the in-group (foundation one), and deference to authority
				(foundation two). Three decades later, the Khmer Rouge used a similar moral justification for the genocide of three million
				citizens to stop the “corrupting” influence of the west and for the "purification of the populace" [2]. It's time we
				end the moral relativism and name the first three moral foundations as false foundations. </p>

			<p>During the war in Iraq which began in 2003, personnel of the US Army and CIA committed physical and sexual abuse, torture,
				rape, and murder against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The soldiers carrying out these heinous acts were
				explicitly told many of these actions were legal, and therefore morally valid. The few soldiers convicted in these crimes
				would described an environment where commanding officers would condone the use of torture and expect soldiers to carry
				out their orders, both explicit and implicit. The soldiers had a story justifying their actions founded upon the moral
				authority of their superiors (foundation two) and the importance of protecting their country no matter the cost to others
				(foundation one). Nearly all war crimes committed by soldiers follow a similar moral foundation of resting upon the precepts
				of deference to authority and loyalty to the in-group.</p>

			<p>Time again we see hate crimes, war crimes, and countless heinous acts are done with a moral story resting on one of the
				first three moral foundations. Rarely do we see violent convulsions of hate telling a moral story based on any of the
				last three moral foundations.</p>

			<p>The inverse is also true. The great heroic actors in modern history all seem to be motivated by a moral story resting
				on one of the last three foundations. Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr, the great leaders of non-violent revolution,
				first fought for freedom on behalf of their own people (foundation six), before both maturing into leaders who talked
				about fairness, equality, and freedom for all oppressed people (foundations four and five). </p>

			<p>More recently, Edward Snowden justified his illegal whistleblowing using language related to freedom (foundation six)
				and limiting harm (foundation four). </p>

			<p>False moral foundations have no place in the caring and rational culture of the future we are trying to build.</p>

			<p>The great moral thinkers of the west, including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Nozick, and Rawls all worked on systematizing
				the last three moral foundations into various moral theories, from Utilitarianism (foundation four) to Rawls Theory of
				Justice (foundation five and six) among others. These moral philosophers saw moral arguments stemming from the first
				three moral foundations as irrational amorality, incapable of forming the basis for a rational moral theory. </p>

				</div>

			<p>We are living in a time of hate-fuelled violence. It is time to end the moral relativism and clearly name the first three
				moral foundations as false foundations that serve to justify the unjustifiable. These false moral foundations have no
				place in the caring and rational culture of the future. The false foundations are not just found in the moral story of
				murderers and torturers trying to justify their monstrous acts. They are also found in the speech of politicians pushing
				demagoguery and attenuated hate. Trump is well versed in pushing a moral story that places American lives above all others,
				even to the extent of murdering the innocent families of terrorists to dissuade violence upon American families (foundation
				one). Trump is also well versed in reasoning from disgust (foundation three). Jesse Graham, a professor of psychology
				at the University of Southern California, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/opinion/campaign-stops/purity-disgust-and-donald-trump.html">elaborated</a> on the purity-disgust dimension of Trump's campaign [3]:</p>

			<blockquote>"More than any other Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump has been appealing to a particular combination of in-group
				loyalty and moral purity concerns. On the purity side, he often expresses disgust, often toward women and women’s bodies
				(e.g., Clinton’s bathroom break during a Democratic debate). But his purity appeals are most commonly in the context
				of group boundaries, like building walls on our national borders to prevent contamination by outsiders, who are cast
				as murderers and rapists, both morally and physically dirty."</blockquote>

			<p>According to Graham, Trump is also pushing an authoritarian tone (foundation two):</p>

			<blockquote>"Trump is more domineering than the other candidates, bullying opponents and reporters alike, calling them losers, refusing
				to ever apologize for anything. This could indeed appeal to those high in social-dominance orientation and authoritarianism,
				particularly those who mistake such domineering for actual authority."</blockquote>

			<p>Here in Canada, appeals to the false moral foundations tend to be more subtle. The "Barbaric Practices Hotline" borne
				by the Conservative Party of Canada was more likely created to incite feelings of in-group loyalty and disgust at outside
				cultures than to actually protect vulnerable citizens. </p>
				
			<p>In Europe, alt-right racist and nationalist parties are seeing a resurgence, using language drawn from a mixture of in-group
				authoritarianism and disgust at outsiders polluting a pure Europe.</p>

			<p>For the future of our world, and the sanity of our culture, we need to learn to identify false moral reasoning, and call
				bullshit whenever we see it. We need to explain it until it is downright <em>embarrassing</em> to be caught reasoning
				from a false foundation. </p>

			<p><a href="http://www.pads.ac.uk/pages/research/pads_theory.html">Situational Actions Theory</a> (SAT) suggests that moral context and reasoning has a real impact on whether someone will decide
				commit a crime [4]. SAT finds a person’s moral reasoning can significantly encourage or discourage the commission of
				violence, often even more than even their personal propensity for violence.</p>

			<p>If we can remove the false foundations as valid moral stories within our society, then maybe the next time a hateful bigot
				considers the use of violence against innocent people, a tiny rational corner of their mind might remind them that they
				are not thinking clearly about the moral implications of what they are about to do. </p>
